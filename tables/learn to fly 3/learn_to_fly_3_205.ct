  Description:
  This disables the anticheat from detecting you changing numbers.
  Mostly everything I could think of is stored as a double. This includes but
  is not limited to money, BP, and fuel. You'll need to scan for the data
  yourself, but that shouldn't be too hard. Go to the cheat engine forums if
  you need help.

  Instructions:
  Refresh the page, then activate the script at the "Start Game" screen prior
  to clicking on anything. If you do not, the script may still activate, but it
  may not have any effect on the gameplay. I will not be held responsible for
  you needing to reset your save because it detected you. So back it up before
  making any changes.
  To disable, reload the page.

  Other Information:
  Check out the cheat engine forums for more tables, trainers, and tutorials:
  http://forum.cheatengine.org/

  Feel free to use this script however you like so long as you provide proper
  credit.

  This script unlocks all bodies, launchers, stages, boosts, music, and
  customization items for purchase (yes, even ones that need a code). This is
  not permanent and will need to be re-enabled if you start the game again.

  Refresh the page, then activate the script at the "Start Game" screen prior
  to clicking on anything. If you do not, the script may still activate, but it
