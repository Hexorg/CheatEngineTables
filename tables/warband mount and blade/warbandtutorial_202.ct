===========Health Hack= Main Hack==========

1-Open Mount and blade and go to a battle. OPen cheat engine and attach it to the process.
2- See how much health you have.Scan for it using Float.
(hint: scan for adress between 40000000 and 50000000)
3-Take damage, and see how much damage you have taken.
Scan for decreased value by [damage taken].
4- You may have found 1 adress, if not repeat step 3 till you find only one.
Right click the adress and left click find out what access this adress.
5-Go to the game, move forward,go back to cheat engine.
6-look for something like fld dword ptr [edi+00006FE4]
FLD is constantly accessing health adress, because it displays it on screen.
7-Click show in disassembler.
press ctrl+A, it will open the Auto Assembler.
You dont need to know much of assembly, because theres usefull templates.
Go templates-&gt; cheat table framework.
Go templates-&gt; code injection-&gt; press ok.
8-In newmem ( new memory label) write the following instruction.
mov [register+offset],(float)1000.
MOV= Move 1000(float) into health adress.
note: You can die if you take damage higher than 1000, so put a high value.
9-Health hack is done, but you can use the same script to make Ammo hack, No reload hack
and horse health hack.




=========AMMO HACK==========
1-waste 2 bolts/bullets/arrows.Scan for 2 ( 4 bytes).
2- waste 2 more ammo.Scan for 4.
Get only one adress.
3- Get health adress.
Do the equation:
[health adress - offset]= edi
[ammo adress - edi]= offset
If offset is Negative ( something like FFFFFF20).
Do Edi - ammo adress instead of ammo adress - edi.( if you did edi - ammo adress, use - in the script).
4-Put in the script:
mov [edi+- offset],0 // mov ammo adress to 0.* tell the game you used 0 ammo, so you keep max ammo.



=======No reload=======
Easy one
Using data/structure dissector I've found that both in warband and wfas, the no reload is ammo adress -8.
Its a value that changes from 0 (Reloaded) to 1 ( no reloaded).
Put in the script:
mov [edi+-offset],0 //Remenber, the offset is 8 less than ammo adress offset.(hexadecimal).
Hexadecimal notes:
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 10 11 12 13 14...Hexadecimal
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20...decimal



=========Horse health=======
1- See in inventory what is the max horse health.Mine was 100hp.
2- enter battle.Scan in cheat engine for horse health.
3-Lose horse health.Scan for decreased value by [damage horse has taken].
4-get one adress.
5- Get your health adress.
do [Phealth - Offset]= register
[Hhealth - register] = offset.
My horse offset was negative, so i did it inverse.
write in the script:
mov [register -+ offset],(float)1000
Done!



======Notes======
*Hope you can understand.
*If did not work, try checking on VERTICAL SYNC.
*Money and stats adress is stored as 4 bytes.
*Renowm, right to rule and honour is stored as 4 bytes too, and are very easy to hack.
